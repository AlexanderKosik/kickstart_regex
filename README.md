# What is this?
This is a programme for learning *Regular Expressions* (RegEx). The goal for this course is to introduce several RegEx features and uses cases.

During the course we use the Python Programming Language. It is highly recommended that you follow along with the course material, do the exercises and experiment for yourself. The easiest way to do this is to have a Python distribution installed and running. See the [Python website](www.python.org) for a python package.

If you do not want to install or use Python, then make sure to use an online RegEx editor like [RegEx 101](www.regex101.com) or [Regexr](https://regexr.com/). While it is still possible to follow along with the examples, it may be more work for you to set up the exercises and run them. If you have Python installed you can check your solution by copying and pasting the examples directly into a Python prompt and executing them.
