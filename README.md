# What is this?
This is a programme for Learning Regular Expressions. The goal for this course is to introduce several features and uses cases 

During the course we use the Python Programming Language. It is highly recommended that you follow along with the course material, do the exercises and experiment for yourself. For that it would be the easiest way to have a running Python distribution. See [Python website](www.python.org) for a python package. 

If you do not want to install or use Python than make sure to use an online RegEx Editor like [RegEx 101](www.regex101.com) or [Regexr](https://regexr.com/). While it is still possible to follow along the examples, it may be more work to set them up and running instead of copy+pasting the examples directly into a Python prompt.
