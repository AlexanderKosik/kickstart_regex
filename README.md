# What is this?
This is a programme for learning Regular Expressions (RegEx). The goal for this course is to introduce several RegEx features and uses cases. 

During the course we use the Python Programming Language. It is highly recommended that you follow along with the course material, do the exercises and experiment for yourself. For that it would be the easiest way to have a Python distribution installed and running. See [Python website](www.python.org) for a python package. 

If you do not want to install or use Python, than make sure to use an online RegEx Editor like [RegEx 101](www.regex101.com) or [Regexr](https://regexr.com/). While it is still possible to follow along the examples, it may be more work for you to set up the exercises and run them. If you have Python installed you can check your solution by copy+pasting the examples directly into a Python prompt and execute them.
